# Hollow-Knight-Cheat

A utility for changing save files for the game Hollow Knight, based on decryption and encryption of files, written in Python 3.
It is a GUI (graphical user interface) for conveniently changing values.

## Requirements

If you want to run the Python script via Python you need to install the following package:
```
pip install wheel
pip install pycryptodome
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

Install all of the above modules before use. If you succeed, the console will start, and then the program itself. Everything in the interface is intuitive to anyone. If it doesn't work, click the `"NOT WORKING?"` button and paste the path to your Hollow Knight folder there.
